Mathematics of networks
Networks and their representation
Weighted and directed networks
The adjacency, Laplacian, and incidence matrices
Degree, paths, components
Independent paths, connectivity, and cut sets
Measures and metrics
Degree centrality, eigenvector centrality, katz centrality, PageRank
Hubs and authorities, closeness centrality, betweenness centrality
Transitivity, reciprocity, similarity, assortative mixing
The large-scale structure of networks
Components
Motivation, different sources of network data, types of networks, tools for visualizing network data, review of graph theory basics.
Structural properties of networks: Notions of centrality, cohesiveness of subgroups, roles and positions, structural equivalence, equitable partitions, stochastic block models.
Cascading properties of networks: Information/influence diffusion on networks, maximizing influence spread, power law and heavy tail distributions, preferential attachment models, small world phenomenon.
Mining Graphs: Community and cluster detection: random walks, spectral methods; link analysis for web mining.
