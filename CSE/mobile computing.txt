mobile computing (mc) : introduction to mc, novel applications, limitations, and architecture. gsm : mobile services, system architecture, radio interface, protocols, localization and calling, handover, security, and new data services. (wireless) medium access control : motivation for a specialized mac (hidden and exposed terminals, near and far terminals), sdma, fdma, tdma, cdma. mobile network layer : mobile ip (goals, assumptions, entities and terminology, ip packet delivery, agent advertisement and discovery, registration, tunneling and encapsulation, optimizations), dynamic host configuration protocol (dhcp). mobile transport layer : traditional tcp, indirect tcp, snooping tcp, mobile tcp, fast retransmit/fast recovery, transmission /time-out freezing, selective retransmission, transaction oriented tcp. database issues : hoarding techniques, caching invalidation mechanisms, client server computing with adaptation, power-aware and context-aware computing, transactional models, query processing, recovery, and quality of service issues. data dissemination: communications asymmetry, classification of new data delivery mechanisms, pushbased mechanisms, pull-based mechanisms, hybrid mechanisms, selective tuning (indexing) techniques. mobile ad hoc networks (manets): overview, properties of a manet, spectrum of manet applications, routing and various routing algorithms, security in manets. protocols and tools : wireless application protocol-wap. (introduction, protocol architecture, and treatment of protocols of all layers), bluetooth (user scenarios, physical layer, mac layer, networking, security, link management) and j2me.
