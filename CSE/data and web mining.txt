Combining multiple models (bagging, boosting, stacking) 
Minimum Description Length Principle (MLD) 
Experiments with Weka - training and testing 
Mining real data 
Preprocessing data from a real medical domain (310 patients with Hepatitis C). 
Applying various data mining techniques to create a comprehensive and accurate model of the data. 
Clustering 
Basic issues in clustering 
First conceptual clustering system: Cluster/2 
Partitioning methods: k-means, expectation maximization (EM) 
Hierarchical methods: distance-based agglomerative and divisible clustering 
Conceptual clustering: Cobweb 
Experiments with Weka - k-means, EM, Cobweb
